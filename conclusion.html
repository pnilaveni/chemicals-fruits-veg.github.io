        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The use of chemicals in agriculture has both advantages and disadvantages. While they help in controlling pests and increasing crop yields, the excessive and improper use of pesticides can have severe consequences on human health and the environment. Through this website, we have explored the harmful effects of chemical residues, the associated health risks, and safer alternatives like organic farming.</p>
        <p>It is essential for consumers to be aware of the dangers of chemical residues on their food. Washing and peeling fruits and vegetables, as well as choosing organic options, can reduce exposure. Farmers should also be encouraged to adopt sustainable practices to protect both human health and the environment. Ultimately, a balance must be achieved between maximizing agricultural productivity and minimizing the negative impact on our planet.</p>
