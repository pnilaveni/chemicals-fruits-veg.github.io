        <h2>Organic and Natural Alternatives</h2>
        <p>With increasing concerns over the harmful effects of chemicals on health and the environment, many farmers are turning to organic and natural methods of cultivation. Organic farming emphasizes the use of natural substances and avoids synthetic chemicals altogether. In India, traditional farming practices have long utilized organic methods, such as using cow dung, compost, and neem oil as natural fertilizers and pesticides.</p>
        <p>One of the most popular natural alternatives to chemical pesticides is neem oil. Extracted from the seeds of the neem tree, this oil has been used for centuries in India to control pests. It acts as a repellent, disrupts insect reproduction, and reduces feeding, making it an effective and eco-friendly solution. Additionally, companion planting, where certain crops are grown together to repel pests naturally, can also reduce the need for synthetic pesticides.</p>
        <p>Another key aspect of organic farming is crop rotation. By rotating crops, farmers can prevent the buildup of pests and diseases in the soil, reducing the need for chemical treatments. This practice also helps in maintaining soil fertility, as different crops enrich the soil with various nutrients. Organic farmers often rely on composting to provide essential nutrients to the soil, promoting healthy plant growth without the need for chemical fertilizers.</p>
        <p>While organic produce is typically more expensive than conventionally grown crops, the long-term benefits of reduced chemical exposure, improved health, and environmental sustainability make it a worthwhile investment. Consumers are increasingly seeking out organic products, supporting farmers who prioritize natural and sustainable farming methods.</p>
